#1. Create a list called animals that contain the following: cat, dog, manta ray, horse, crouching tiger
animals = ["cat","dog", "manta ray","horse", "crouching tiger"]

3. Programmatically reorganize the countdown list below in descending order and return the value of the 5th element in the sorted countdown list.

    The 5th element will be stored in the variable the_fifth_element, which currently below has a dummy value of -999.
    Remember, the index number of the 5th element is not 5

6. Using the following dictionary .. (Use python to solve for the answer.)

dict = {"Course": "DATA 606", "Program": "MSDS", "School": "CUNYSPS"}
a. What is the name of the course?

b. Change the course to DATA602

c. Add new information to the dictionary - "Professor" with "Schettini"

d. Using the len function, find how many keys there are in the dictionary.
